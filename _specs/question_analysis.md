# Question Analysis Stream Process

## 1. Initial Current Events Check
- Call `check_current_events_context` with the question
- Get back analysis of whether current events context is needed
- Analysis includes:
  - Whether context is required
  - Reasoning
  - Relevant timeframe
  - Key events to look for
  - Suggested search queries

## 2. Context Gathering (if needed)
If `requires_current_context` is true:
- Take the search queries from the current events check
- Execute all queries in parallel using `gather_current_events_context`
- Deduplicate results by URL
- Take top 5 most relevant results
- Create a context summary in format:
  ```
  Current Events Context:
  - [Title 1]: [Snippet 1]
  - [Title 2]: [Snippet 2]
  ...etc
  ```

## 3. Question Enhancement
- If current events context was needed:
  - Append the context summary to original question
- If no context needed:
  - Use original question as is

## 4. Full Analysis
- Stream the analysis of the enhanced question through the LLM
- Analysis includes:
  - Key components
  - Scope boundaries
  - Success criteria
  - Conflicting viewpoints
