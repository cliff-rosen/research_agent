| Step | Name | Input | Output | Description |
|------|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Initial Question Receipt | Raw question from user | Documented question | Capture the original question exactly as presented by the user, preserving all context and specific terminology |
| 2 | Question Analysis & Scope Definition | Documented question | • List of key components requiring answers<br>• Specific scope boundaries<br>• Success criteria for a complete answer<br>• Known conflicting viewpoints to investigate | Break down the question to identify its core elements and create a structured list of points that must be addressed. Identify potential areas of controversy or conflicting interpretations that need investigation |
| 3 | Query Expansion | Core question elements from step 2 | • Set of related search terms<br>• Alternative phrasings<br>• Related concepts<br>• Terms for opposing viewpoints | Develop comprehensive search terms including terminology used by different schools of thought or opposing views on the topic |
| 4 | Source Identification | Expanded query terms | • Curated list of relevant pages/sources<br>• Source categorization by viewpoint<br>• Source authority assessment | Identify and compile sources, explicitly marking those that represent different perspectives or potentially conflicting information |
| 5 | Information Extraction | Source list | • Collection of information "nuggets"<br>• Conflict markers for contradictory information<br>• Source context metadata | Extract key information, flagging any contradictions between sources and preserving contextual information that might explain discrepancies |
| 6 | Information Analysis | Collection of information nuggets | • Evaluated and categorized nuggets<br>• Identification of information gaps<br>• Assessment of source reliability<br>• Conflict analysis report | Analyze information for relevance and reliability, explicitly documenting contradictions between sources and evaluating the strength of competing claims |
| 7 | Conflict Resolution | • Conflict analysis report<br>• Source metadata<br>• Nugget context | • Resolved conflicts with explanation<br>• Uncertainty documentation<br>• Multiple valid viewpoints where applicable | Evaluate conflicting information using criteria such as:<br>• Source authority<br>• Recency of information<br>• Strength of evidence<br>• Contextual factors<br>• Methodological differences |
| 8 | Answer Formulation | • Analyzed information nuggets<br>• Resolved conflicts<br>• Uncertainty documentation | Draft answer with:<br>• Supporting evidence<br>• Alternate viewpoints<br>• Uncertainty indicators | Construct preliminary answer incorporating resolved conflicts and clearly presenting any remaining uncertainties or valid alternative viewpoints |
| 9 | Answer Evaluation | • Draft answer<br>• Original question<br>• Success criteria<br>• Conflict resolution documentation | • Gap analysis<br>• Balance assessment<br>• Improvement recommendations | Evaluate answer for completeness, balance in presenting different viewpoints, and appropriate handling of uncertainties |
| 10 | Iterative Refinement | • Current answer version<br>• Gap analysis<br>• Balance assessment<br>• Improvement recommendations | Refined answer version | Make targeted improvements, potentially returning to earlier steps if conflict resolution needs strengthening or additional viewpoints need investigation |
| 11 | Final Answer Production | • Refined answer<br>• Complete conflict resolution documentation | Final answer with:<br>• Complete citations<br>• Source attributions<br>• Confidence levels<br>• Documented uncertainties<br>• Alternative viewpoints where relevant | Produce final answer with proper attribution, clear presentation of any conflicts and their resolution, and appropriate indication of confidence levels and uncertainties |
